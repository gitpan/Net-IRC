This is the old ToDo file. New ToDo items are in the main README file now,
but everything below still needs to be done... bleh.

Things to do for the next revision:
===================================

  - Fix the funky parse case for Undernet "Closing Link" messages:
	Closing Link: Natsune[i.got.net] by NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org
        (Excess Flood)

  - Write more documentation.

  - Fix this case:

	QIUT
        QIUT :Unknown command

  -  Test the server notice stuff. (both "NOTICE :foo" and ":server.com NOTICE :foo")

  -  Allow chained handlers, and have add_handler return the old handler(s)?

  -  Fix the colons-getting-lost problem in message parsing.

  -  Allow users to do "MODE #channel" to retrieve current channel settings.

  -  Fix Modes (mode -m causes problems)

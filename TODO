Things to do for the next revision:
===================================

  - Fix the funky parse case for Undernet "Closing Link" messages:
	Closing Link: Natsune[i.got.net] by NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org
        (Excess Flood)

  - Write more documentation, or at least the event list for Event.pm...

  - Fix Connection->quit() to not close the connection so quickly.

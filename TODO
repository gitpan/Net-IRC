Things to do for 0.52:
======================

  - Fix CTCP PING (again)

  - Fix the funky parse case for Undernet "Closing Link" messages:
	Closing Link: Natsune[i.got.net] by NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org
        (Excess Flood)

  - Allow a user's callbacks to give a filehandle to DCC::GET, so that they
    can choose where to save it.

  - Fix Connection->quit() to not close the connection so quickly.

Revision history for Perl extension Net::IRC.

0.1    Fri Oct 17 00:25:41 CDT 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.2    Sat Oct 18 16:00:38 CDT 1997
 	- it works now, thanks entirely to Tkil (tkil@scrye.com)
 	- substantial cleanup of Connection.pm
	- Removed "Written and designed by:" line in header comments...
	  it didn't seem fair to the many other people who are putting
	  such studly efforts into this.

0.25   Sun Oct 19 06:26:36 CDT 1997
	- Removed extraneous return values from handler code (don't ask)
	- It's now possible to have more than one Net::IRC object in a
	  single script, but I can't see why you'd ever want to.
	- We now disconnect properly. Woohoo!
	- Fixed YA CTCP bug.
	- Fixed up parse() handling for cases like MODE and NICK.
	- Fixed many stupid bugs that should have been caught long ago.
	- Lots more, but I can't remember them all. Again, huge gigantic
	  thanks are due to Tkil for his tireless dedication to hunting
	  down and patching bugs. You go, man!

0.26   Mon Oct 20 01:37:39 CDT 1997
	- Fixed Makefile.PL to install IRC.pm and the other module in
	  different places (it's nice to have make install actually work.)

0.27   Mon Oct 20 23:28:48 CDT 1997
	- Made trivial changes to the formatted output code (format(),
	  Event->new(), _pr(), Connection->new()). This should give other
	  developers a bit clearer idea of where I'm going with it. Time
	  for extended hacking is scarce right now, alas.

0.28   Fri Oct 24 06:12:42 CDT 1997
	- Added $conn->me("#perl", "hacks billn to pieces") as an alias to
	  $conn->ctcp("action", "#perl", "hacks billn to pieces").
	- Fixed a couple small errors (typos, mostly).

0.29   Sat Oct 25 16:48:19 CDT 1997
	- Changed "require 5.004;" to "use 5.004;" in IRC.pm.
	- Added a placeholder DCC.pm to the source tree so I won't have to
	  go back and change stuff once it's written.
	- Changed the order of default nick/ircname variables.
	- Fixed the source tree and makedist script on execpc.com to allow
	  for easier diffing and patching.

0.3    Tue Nov 25 02:49:37 CST 1997
	- Makefile.PL now barfs on older versions of Perl.
	- IRC.pm caches $self->ioselect in select() to clean up the code
	  a little. OO and procedural style bigots reach a compromise.
	- IRC.pm's start() and select() methods have been merged.
	- All eval "code;" statements changed to eval { code; }.
	- Made small adjustment to Connection->parse() numeric routine.
	- Working draft of DCC.pm written by borys, who kicks much ass.
	- Bunch of subsequent revisions to DCC.pm, mostly by archon.
	- irctest script nearly doubles in size.
	- IRC.pm, especially start(), gets modified for DCC.pm.
	- A bunch of other smaller changes associated with DCC.pm that
	  I'm too tired to write down. You get the idea.
	- Spent HOURS hacking miscellaneous CTCP and parse() bugs. Millions
	  of thanks to Silmaril for devoting his brainpower to the bughunt.

0.31   Wed Nov 26 00:19:30 CST 1997
	- Fixed the irritating "Sender: owner-test@betterbox.net" bug in the
	  mailing list config. OK, so it doesn't belong in this file, but I
	  guess it's worth mentioning somewhere.
	- ctcp_reply() method added to Connection.pm and used in irctest.

0.32   Wed Dec  3 07:59:28 CST 1997
	- Added new_send(), new_get(), and new_chat() to Connection.pm
	- Removed ^A-removing stuff in DCC.pm (it's been fixed in Connection).
	- Completely rewrote the irctest script, with more additions planned.
	- The numeric event stuff has been farmed off from parse() to a
	  separate routine, parse_num(). This part is going to present a big
	  problem in weeks ahead... Jarkko Oikarinen should be shot.
	- Default block size for DCC SEND now 1k instead of 8k.
	- DCC SEND and GET now always do binary transfers. If a problem comes
	  up with this, blame it on tchrist and BeeF. :-)

0.33   Fri Dec  5 14:27:41 CST 1997
	- Version numbers now more realistic.
        - Net::IRC now specifically resides under the Artistic License, which
	  is now distributed with the module. Anyone have a problem with this?
	- Connection.pm now strips CRs as well as LFs. Thanks, Aryeh!
	- \r and \n hardcoded as \015 and \012 in some places to avoid
	  possible cross-platform confusion.
	- Problems with certain literal handler calls fixed in handler().
	- irctest is now a full-featured Zippybot! Yow!!
	- Made a first pathetic stab at documentation, still working on it.

0.4    Wed Dec 10 16:08:21 CST 1997
	- Made small changes to arg list for DCC::CHAT->new().
	- Fixed precedence problem in Connection->new_* methods.
	- Added DCC CHAT and GET capabilities to irctest.
	- Added 'Proto => "tcp",' to all IO::Socket calls in DCC.pm, after
	  being led astray by incorrect documentation. :-)
	- User notification for dropped connections is more polite.
	- Change to fragment handling in IRC->start().
	- DCC CHAT->new() now requires nick as argument.
	- privmsg() can be used to send DCC CHAT messages... just pass it
	  an IO::Socket instead of a nick.
	- Removed some debugging prints that accidentally got left in
	  a few parts of the code. Doh!

0.41   date
	- Fixed the order of args to Connection->ctcp().
	-

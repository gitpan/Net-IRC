Revision history for Perl extension Net::IRC.

0.1    Fri Oct 17 00:25:41 CDT 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.2    Sat Oct 18 16:00:38 CDT 1997
 	- it works now, thanks entirely to Tkil (tkil@scrye.com)
 	- substantial cleanup of Connection.pm
	- Removed "Written and designed by:" line in header comments...
	  it didn't seem fair to the many other people who are putting
	  such studly efforts into this.

0.25   Sun Oct 19 06:26:36 CDT 1997
	- Removed extraneous return values from handler code (don't ask)
	- It's now possible to have more than one Net::IRC object in a
	  single script, but I can't see why you'd ever want to.
	- We now disconnect properly. Woohoo!
	- Fixed YA CTCP bug.
	- Fixed up parse() handling for cases like MODE and NICK.
	- Fixed many stupid bugs that should have been caught long ago.
	- Lots more, but I can't remember them all. Again, huge gigantic
	  thanks are due to Tkil for his tireless dedication to hunting
	  down and patching bugs. You go, man!

0.26   Mon Oct 20 01:37:39 CDT 1997
	- Fixed Makefile.PL to install IRC.pm and the other module in
	  different places (it's nice to have make install actually work.)

0.27   Mon Oct 20 23:28:48 CDT 1997
	- Made trivial changes to the formatted output code (format(),
	  Event->new(), _pr(), Connection->new()). This should give other
	  developers a bit clearer idea of where I'm going with it. Time
	  for extended hacking is scarce right now, alas.

0.28   Fri Oct 24 06:12:42 CDT 1997
	- Added $conn->me("#perl", "hacks billn to pieces") as an alias to
	  $conn->ctcp("action", "#perl", "hacks billn to pieces").
	- Fixed a couple small errors (typos, mostly).

0.29   Sat Oct 25 16:48:19 CDT 1997
	- Added a placeholder DCC.pm to the source tree so I won't have to
	  go back and change stuff once it's written.
	- Changed the order of default nick/ircname variables.
	- Fixed the source tree and makedist script on execpc.com to allow
	  for easier diffing and patching.

0.3    Tue Nov 25 02:49:37 CST 1997
	- Makefile.PL now barfs on older versions of Perl.
	- IRC.pm caches $self->ioselect in select() to clean up the code
	  a little. OO and procedural style bigots reach a compromise.
	- IRC.pm's start() and select() methods have been merged.
	- All eval "code;" statements changed to eval { code; }.
	- Made small adjustment to Connection->parse() numeric routine.
	- Working draft of DCC.pm written by borys, who kicks much ass.
	- Bunch of subsequent revisions to DCC.pm, mostly by archon.
	- irctest script nearly doubles in size.
	- IRC.pm, especially start(), gets modified for DCC.pm.
	- A bunch of other smaller changes associated with DCC.pm that
	  I'm too tired to write down. You get the idea.
	- Spent HOURS hacking miscellaneous CTCP and parse() bugs. Millions
	  of thanks to Silmaril for devoting his brainpower to the bughunt.

0.31   Wed Nov 26 00:19:30 CST 1997
	- Fixed the irritating "Sender: owner-test@betterbox.net" bug in the
	  mailing list config. OK, so it doesn't belong in this file, but I
	  guess it's worth mentioning somewhere.
	- ctcp_reply() method added to Connection.pm and used in irctest.

0.32   Wed Dec  3 07:59:28 CST 1997
	- Added new_send(), new_get(), and new_chat() to Connection.pm
	- Removed ^A-removing stuff in DCC.pm (it's been fixed in Connection).
	- Completely rewrote the irctest script, with more additions planned.
	- The numeric event stuff has been farmed off from parse() to a
	  separate routine, parse_num().
	- Default block size for DCC SEND now 1k instead of 8k.
	- DCC SEND and GET now always do binary transfers. If a problem comes
	  up with this, blame it on tchrist and BeeF. :-)

0.33   Fri Dec  5 14:27:41 CST 1997
	- Version numbers now more realistic.
        - Net::IRC now specifically resides under the Artistic License, which
	  is now distributed with the module. Anyone have a problem with this?
	- Connection.pm now strips CRs as well as LFs. Thanks, Aryeh!
	- \r and \n hardcoded as \015 and \012 in some places to avoid
	  possible cross-platform confusion.
	- Problems with certain literal handler calls fixed in handler().
	- irctest is now a full-featured Zippybot! Yow!!
	- Made a first pathetic stab at documentation, still working on it.

0.4    Wed Dec 10 16:08:21 CST 1997
	- Made small changes to arg list for DCC::CHAT->new().
	- Fixed precedence problem in Connection->new_* methods.
	- Added DCC CHAT and GET capabilities to irctest.
	- Added 'Proto => "tcp",' to all IO::Socket calls in DCC.pm, after
	  being led astray by incorrect documentation. :-)
	- User notification for dropped connections is more polite.
	- Change to fragment handling in IRC->start().
	- DCC CHAT->new() now requires nick as argument.
	- privmsg() can be used to send DCC CHAT messages... just pass it
	  an IO::Socket instead of a nick.
	- Removed some debugging prints that accidentally got left in
	  a few parts of the code. Doh!

0.41   Wed Dec 10 22:36:10 CST 1997
	- Fixed the order of args to Connection->ctcp().
	- Fixed lots of bugs that this change caused to manifest. Argh.
	- First Net::IRC release posted to CPAN, 11 Dec 1997.

0.42   Mon Dec 29 22:44:18 CST 1997
	- Added dcc_open and dcc_close handlers for DCC connections.
	- DCC::GET now requires a nick as an argument to new().
	- Added motd, users, whowas, ison, lusers, userhost and wallops subs
	  to Connection.pm.
	- Added event scheduler to IRC.pm and Connection.pm. Good idea, Che!
	- &AUTOLOAD in Connection.pm completely rewritten by gbacon.
	- Applied a nifty patch that breaks big messages to privmsg() and
	  notice() into smaller chunks and sends them piecemeal.
	- irctest now does DCC SEND via public message, as a demonstration.
	- Real POD documentation for IRC.pm written; work begun on PODs for
	  the rest, but it's a nontrivial task.
	- Added do_one_loop() patch to IRC.pm and rewrote start() for easier
	  Tk integration with Net::IRC scripts.
	- Fixed user mode case in Connection->parse().
	- Added a timeout() method to IRC.pm for finer user control over the
	  select loop. Woo woo!

0.43   Tue Dec 30 18:20:26 CST 1997
	- Fixed some problems with the previous distribution... a few outdated
	  files weren't properly removed before tarring by a particularly
	  mischevious script.

0.44   Wed Dec 31 18:13:32 CST 1997
	- Fixed some newly created bugs with Connection->connected. Argh!
	- Scrapped and redid distribution-rolling scripts. You know,
	  ExtUtils::MakeMaker is really nice.

0.45   Sat Jan  3 15:48:57 CST 1998
	- All connections now give their names and causes of death upon
	  expiring. This should make DCC problems much less confusing. :-)
	- DCC SEND and CHAT no longer block on accept(). Woohoo!
	- IRC->remove_conn() changed to removeconn() for consistency with
	  IRC->addconn() and IRC->newconn().

0.5b   Sun Mar 15 14:29:09 CST 1998
	- Sizable chunks of IRC, DCC, and Connection.pm rewritten according to
	  wise suggestions from the venerable elders \merlyn and Roderick.
	- addfh() and removefh() methods added to IRC.pm; changed() and
	  closed(), having been rendered utterly useless, were removed.
	- Reading data from ready non-{DCC,Connection} sockets is now the
	  responsibility of the user. This provides more flexibility (if you
	  only want to read N bytes, if it's a buffered FH and not a socket,
	  etc.), but will break any existing such code. Better now than later.
	- Various documentation updates for IRC.pm; more progress made on the
	  as-yet-unreleased Connection.pm docs. Any volunteers to help out
	  with the PODs?
	- The select loop now monitors writable and errored filehandles as
	  well as readable ones. See the updated documentation for IRC.pm.
	- Chat request feature added to irctest... if you say anything
	  matching /^Chat/i on a channel with your bot, it will try to
	  initiate a DCC CHAT with you. Mostly for debugging purposes, but
	  it might actually be useful to someone out there anyhow...
	- A bug report from Che_Fox led to the squashing of a bug in privmsg
	  that kept it from properly trimming long lines before sending.
	- Johnathan Vasilis pointed out a quickly-fixed bug in Connection->
	  userhost(). Thanks!
	- Events now trim preceding colons properly. Happy now, longhair? :-)
	- Fixed a big fat bug with _add_generic_handler. Setting up multiple
	  handlers with arrayrefs works again now.
	- Connection.pm and DCC.pm's input routines now actually throw a
	  "disconnect" or "dcc_close" event for connection-losing errors.
	- Alex Ibrado's bug report resulted in the fixing of some stupid bugs
	  in the kick, topic, squit, and wallops methods. Doh...
	- Added Tkil's monster patch to fix Connection->parse errors, among
	  other things. You go, Tkil!

0.5    Wed Apr  1 23:28:13 CST 1998 
	- Added a few Undernet compatibility changes suggested by Che_Fox.
	- Fixed a really dumb bug in Connection->default. Umm, doh.
	- DCC.pm got a number of miscellaneous changes, including making
	  $dcc->{_time} actually useful for SEND and CHAT, and adding events
	  for dcc_open and dcc_close all over. Thanks, mjd!
	- Fixed some evil bugs in DCC.pm... CHAT could call autoflush() on
	  the result of a failed IO::Socket->new(), and DCC GET had an odd
	  hanging problem on the last block of a file. *Many* thanks to the
	  indefatigable \mjd for spotting and patching the latter.
	- Added sanity checks to DCC.pm to prevent abuse by malicious remote
	  clients. Net::IRC -- making the world safe for bots, one Boolahman
	  at a time!
	- Stupid low-level CTCP dequoting bug fixed on a report from \mjd.
	- Even stupider Connection->server bug tracked down and stomped.

0.51   Tue May 19 01:03:57 CDT 1998 
	- Aryeh patched a few minor bugs in the formatting functions.
	- Problem with the select timeout in do_one_loop() squashed.
	- Minor changes to dain-bramaged parts of DCC::CHAT::parse().
	- Connection::parse() is now much friendlier to "localhost" servers.
	- Added another error check to IRC::schedule() (thanks, Cuberoot!)
	- Connection::sl() won't send \r\n over DCC CHAT anymore.
	- All "return undef"s changed to "return;" as per gbacon's suggestion.
	- irctest now uses strict -- it was mostly strict-safe before, but I
	  had forgotten the actual 'use'... doh. Thanks, arkuat!
	- tile is the DCC God. A two-line patch of his fixed an ugly DCC
	  CHAT blocking bug I'd been hacking on for a few days. You GO, tile!
	- The Net::IRC source now uses Carp for all error reporting.
	- The setout() and seterr() methods are dead as a result of the
	  previous change. You'll have to do your own tee'ing... sorry.

0.52   Tue Jun  9 21:16:53 CDT 1998
        - Fixed a stupid bug introduced in 0.51 which causes Net::IRC to
	  attack the CPU like a rabid wolverine. Mea culpa. You just don't
	  notice these things as much when you're testing each new version
	  on a quad-CPU UltraSparc. :-)
	- Fixed an oddity with irctest's cping handler which caused it to
	  no longer work with the current version of Net::IRC.
	- Formats will actually work with CTCP events now. Doh.
	- Added Event->dump method to spew the contents of an Event object
	  to STDERR for debugging. This is a good thing.

0.53   Fri Jun 12 20:25:02 CDT 1998
	- Fixed compatibility problems with Net::IRC on MacPerl. Many thanks
	  to Chris Nandor for bringing this to our attention...
	- Jonathan Vasilis spotted an incompatibility between ircd 2.9 and
	  Net::IRC, which has since been squashed. Thanks, Jon!
	- One can now pass Connection->new_get() an open filehandle as the
	  last argument to specify a particular filename for incoming DCC
	  SENDs. Naturally, when you don't provide the extra argument, the
	  behavior is the same as before.

0.54   Sun Jun 28 18:49:03 CDT 1998
	- IRC::addfh() now requires only two arguments. In the absence of
	  any indication of what you're using the filehandle for, it will
	  assume you're reading from it. Previous behavior is, of course,
	  unchanged.
	- Connection::pr() finally got diked out. Took long enough...
	- Minor doc fixes all over and cosmetic changes to irctest.
	- List of events added to Event.pm documentation (finally!).
	- The add_*handler functions will accept upper, lower, or mixed-case
	  event names indiscriminately now.


0.56b  Tue Dec 29 13:37:01 CST 1998
	- The Makefile.PL was edited slightly for compatibility with nmake.
	  Thanks to Duncan Harris for the bug report on this one.
	- DCC CHAT objects can now send messages by calling the new privmsg()
	  method... $chat->privmsg('string to send...'); . Useful, no?
	- The indefatigable oznoid spent a good deal of his hard-earned
	  time chasing down a pernicious connection bug. Way to go!
	- Fixed, at long last, the "Read error" bugs in Connection->quit().
	- Repaired some manifest idiocy in irctest. (Whoops. Thanks, Stupid_!)
	- Fixed the new CORE::join warnings that crop up under 5.005. Grrrrr.
	- Some debugging code added. Set DEBUG to 1 at the top of IRC.pm to
	  enable verbose spewage of the module's actions. Still needs fleshing
	  out, and needs some more debugging code in DCC.pm too.
	- Net::IRC now dies by default when there are no open connections
	  left. (Install a 'disconnect' handler to avoid this.)  This keeps it
	  from ending up in a tight select loop over no sockets, which chews
	  up CPU like mad.
	- Fixed a parse problem where the handler for numeric events would
	  grab non-numeric server messages, like "ERROR :Closing Link". Heh.
	- Added disconnect() method to Connection.pm, to ensure that
	  connections die properly BEFORE we call disconnect handlers. This
	  approach is much cleaner... and less buggy.
	- The handler which gets executed just before the quit() method
	  issues a QUIT command (for saying things before you leave, etc.)
	  is now known as "leaving", not "disconnect". This is a USER-VISIBLE
	  CHANGE which may break some of existing code. BE WARNED.
	- addconn() is now only called from Connection->connect(), and
	  removeconn only from Connection->disconnect(). This is a good thing.
	- DCC GET almost works. I accidentally reversed a test in some
	  previous version and totally borked it so that it would die after
	  one packet. Don't I feel like a total doofus... now, for those
	  regression tests...
	- Added a topic handler to irctest on a lark. I get more questions
	  about topic reading/setting than about anything else...
	- Added a "LocalAddr" atribute for Connection->connect(). Setting it
	  to a valid hostname for your machine will cause you to connect with
	  that hostname, instead of whatever default one your DNS will return.
	  (Note: Some paranoid IRC servers don't like this.)

0.57   Mon Mar  1 19:50:03 CST 1999
	- Thanks to Gantoris for pointing out a bug in Event->to(). Now, when
	  called in scalar context, it will return an array reference instead
	  of the number of recipients.
	- fubar@ameritech.net pointed out another motd numeric code which isn't
	  in the (woefully outdated) RFC. If you've ever found yourself never
	  receiving the MOTDs, this version's for you.
	- Many thanks to Moses Moore, who offered some much-needed changes to
	  Connection->privmsg(). Now the first argument can be an arrayref of
	  recipient names, to specify a single message to be sent to multiple
	  nicks/channels.
	- Doru Petrescu <pdoru@kappa.ro> is not just the man. Nor, in fact, is
	  he The Man. THIS is a person who can only be described as THE MAN
	  HIMSELF, and I bow before his studly debugging skills. He sent me a
          two-character fix today that seems to solve all the DCC problems I was
	  having. Boy, do I feel dumb. Thanks, Doru!
	- Everything's been checked into CVS, so I can have more detailed change
	  logging. Hopefully, this will help avoid future rebreakings of DCC.
	- Harald Kreuzer tipped me off to a bug in irctest's on_topic handler
	  subroutine which really should have been caught in testing. Sorry
	  about that... and thanks, Harald!
	- Kajetan Hinner sent me a monster patch against 0.54. I'm still picking
	  the relevant parts out of it, but I've included a couple notable parts
	  from it already... especially all the new event numerics he added.
	
0.58   Thu Apr  8 11:00:58 CDT 1999
	- Oh, dear. Many thanks to kleptog and Epesh for bringing to my
	  attention a really simple, stupid bug which broke scripts using
	  multiple connections. 0.57 was borked. Mea culpa.
	- Added a "Password" parameter to the connect() method, for bots on
	  restricted servers. Updated the docs to reflect this.

0.59   Fri Jun 18 10:52:44 CDT 1999
	- The default timeout for the select loop was changed from 1 to undef.
	  If you're calling Net::IRC via do_one_loop instead of with start(),
	  then you'll probably experience weird freezes with this. Tough. Do a
	  $irc->timeout(0); to make your program run better than ever before, if
	  you weren't already.
	- Cleaned up some bogus ugly code here and there. Don't mind me, I'm
	  just tidying up...
	- Added Tom "tnalpggE" Monroe's nifty patch, which gives us away, rehash, 
	  summon, and restart methods, and improves parsing of numeric events.
	- Andrew Mackenzie kicks ass. After unsuccessfully nagging me to get off
	  my lazy ass and fix a DCC bug, he did it himself. DCC receive now
	  works again. h3o++ !
	- Fixed a bogosity in Connection->mode(). Don't ask.

0.60   Thu Aug 12 16:19:58 EDT 1999
	- Fixed a stupid oversight in the Net::IRC::DCC::SEND::new() method which
	  prevented one from sending files in directories outside of the current
	  directory. Thanks to Frank Tobin for spotting this; sorry it took me so
	  long to fix, but your email got lost in the noise for a couple weeks...
	- Jan L. Peterson sent me a nifty patch which fixes the infamous colon-
	  stripping bug in Event->args(). Sorry it took me so long to fix this
	  one, everybody. Unlike the previous bug, this one has no excuse.
	- Thanks to Jack Velte for pointing out the cause of some spurious
	  "uninitialized value" warnings in Connection.pm.

0.61   Thu Aug 26 22:29:39 EDT 1999
	- Shizukesa pointed out the root cause of a bug that was sending duplicate
	  dcc_close events when DCC connections shut down. Now fixed. He kicks
	  ass. :-)  Added a $dcc->nick accessor method, too, as per his excellent
	  suggestion.

0.62   Wed Sep 22 18:13:28 EDT 1999
	- Vadim Belman spotted two bugs in DCC.pm: one, a mistyping of
	  'socket' as 'sock'; the other, a thoroughly inappropriate use of
	  IO::Socket's LocalPort attribute. Both fixed, as per his patch.
	- Jeremy Muhlich reminded me of a stupid change I made to the
	  select loop several revisions ago which broke the proper behavior
	  of schedule()ed events. Sigh.

0.63   Sun Jan 30 18:50:28 PST 2000
	- Harald Paulsen spent a good deal of time and effort hunting down a
	  couple of really dumb bugs in Connection::parse(). Replaced a couple
	  of "return"s with "next"s and it's all good. Wee!
	- Richard-William Loerakker sent me a patch for DCC on multihomed
	  machines... the DCC code wasn't paying attention to which
	  interface the Connection object was attached to. Thanks, Richard!

0.70   Mon May 29 11:52:26 PDT 2000
	- Igor Shevchenko sent me a patch for DCC.pm which adds support
	  for resuming DCC GETs. I haven't tested this feature, but the
	  code looks right. :-)
	- Finally fixed the pernicious "stripping the first colon" bug.
	  Let's hope it stays dead this time! This may cause you to have to
	  make a minor change to your CTCP handlers... but that's a small
	  price to pay. (Shifting the first arg off should no longer be
	  necessary.)
	- Fixed an ugly DCC bug reported by Matthew Boehm. I can't
	  believe I didn't notice this before! The fix uses Sys::Hostname
	  to determine the machine's IP address; I'm not sure if this works
	  on Windows, but it probably should. Let me know if not.
	- Added Dave Schmitt's unignore patch, which fixes a big omission in
	  Connection.pm -- you can now turn off ignores that you set with
	  ignore(). Nifty!

0.71   Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 GMT 2001
	- Removed debugging information that was printing out weird messages
	  as far as ACTIONs were concerned. Thanks to Joshua Swink, Glen and
	  Mike.
	- Made the LocalAddr option actually work, thanks to Abigail and
	  Greg.
	- Added some more Handlers, from Austnet, thanks to Andrew Macks
	- Updated the documentation 

0.72   Fri Dec 14 13:00:00 GMT 2001
        - Added a patch from Anti Veeranna in Connection.pm to fix the
          problems with IPv6 hostnames. Has not been tested with DCC.

0.73   Wed Jan 02 13:00:00 GMT 2002
        - Anti's Patch broke MODE handling. Implemented a quick fix.

0.74   Wed Apr 16 Sometime GMT 2003
	- Added Pacing
	- Added SSL support
	- Added Time::HiRes conditional support for fractional times
	- Net::IRC::Connection::time -> Net::IRC::Connection::timestamp
	  - Hopefully this doesn't break anyone, this was an undocumented
	    access to the IRC 'TIME' command.
	- Updated docs slightly, pointing to new webpage, etc.

0.75   Fri Apr 30 who cares what time? 2004
	- Hopefully fixed mysterious LocalAddr-related connection problems
	- Rewrote event output system - created EventQueue
	- Added add_default_handler for hooking all events at once
	- UnrealIrcd events added (thanks to Hendrik Frenzel)
        - Conditional require of Time::HiRes now works right in its absence
          (thanks to Adam Monsen <adamm@wazamatta.com>)
	- Massive readability/maintainability changes
	  - Subs ordered in logical order, not alphabetical
	  - Indentation
	- Updated current maintainers (should have been changed for 0.74)
